## Overview

We will process the house prices data to analyze the factors that are 
related to house prices and present the visualizing plots to users.

In particular, we will show the house price distribution, compute the 
average price of different neighborhood and different house style, 
compute the correlation coefficient of different factors and 
show the top factors that affect. 

## Data

We will get the data from Kaggle website, see References.

## Milestones

- 9/30 Read the data, compute the house price distribution and show the plot.

- 10/6 Compute the average price of different neighborhood and different house styles
       and show the plot.
       
- 10/13 Compute the correlation coefficient of different factors and show the top
        affecting factors.
        
- 10/20 Finish the report.

## Programming Language

We will use Python for this project.
